My goal is to demonstrate that deep learning systems, when interacting with other systems, are capable of much more than they can do today. Iâ€™ve worked (or working) on training neural networks to do fact-checking in knowledge base, solve reasoning tasks like mathematics, understand video more efficiently and optimize computation graph generated by compiler. Themes includes learning interleaving with searching. Here is the list of work that I've contributed to:
