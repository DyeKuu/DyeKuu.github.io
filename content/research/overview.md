My goal is to demonstrate that deep learning systems, when interacting with other systems, are capable of much more than they can do today. Iâ€™ve worked (or working) on training neural networks to do fact-checking in knowledge base, solve reasoning tasks like mathematics, understand video more efficiently, optimize computation graph generated by compiler and run faster than traditional algorithm on computational chemistry. Themes includes CV, NLP, learning interleaving with searching, and applied DL. Here is the list of work that I've contributed to:
