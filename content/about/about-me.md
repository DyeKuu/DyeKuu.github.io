I am a 4th-year student in École Polytechnique in France, enrolled in the "Cycle D'Ingénieur" Program. I am also a 2nd-year Master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University as part of my double-degree program.
I have a general background in computer science and mathematics. I obtained my Bachelor degree in a Sino-French institute in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I received intense training of mathematics and physics before I entered into researh.
I have a strong interest in the intersection of deep learning and other fields (such as mathematics). I am also interested in projects that require both
research efforts and engineering efforts. I am currently working as a research intern at [Sea AI Lab](https://example.com) in Singapore. 
I am currently working on a project that accelerates deep learning compiler (XLA) optimization. Before that, I was an intern in OpenAI and participated in 
building an AI that proves mathematics theorem, under the guidance of Stanislas Polu and Jesse Michael Han.
