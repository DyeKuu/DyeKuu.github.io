I am a 4th-year student in École Polytechnique in France, enrolled in the "[Cycle Ingénieur](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program)" Program. I am also a 2nd-year Master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University as part of my double-degree program supervised by [Ya Zhang](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/yazhang/). I am currently working as a research intern at [Sea AI Lab](https://sail.sea.com/) in Singapore, under the guidance of [Lin Min](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=BGONmkIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Wang Yangzihao](https://yzhwang.github.io/). I am working on a project that accelerates deep learning compiler (XLA) optimization and other interesting stuffs. Before that, I was an intern in [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and participated in 
[building an AI that proves mathematics theorem](https://openai.com/blog/formal-math/), under the guidance of [Stanislas Polu](https://spolu.vercel.app/) and [Jesse Michael Han](https://jesse-michael-han.github.io/).

Before École Polytechnique, I obtained my Bachelor degree in a Sino-French [prépa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) institute in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I received intense training of mathematics and physics in French for the entrance to the [Grand École](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole). 

My education gives me training of general background of computer science and mathematics before getting into deep learning. Thanks to [Oana Balalau](https://oanabalalau.com/) and [Ioana Manolescu](https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/ioana.manolescu/), I had my first contact with research in machine learning in [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) late 2019. I always believe that a good and solid research project in the field of deep learning contains both nice ideas and good engineering efforts. This thought is furthured shaped along my trajectory in Stockly, OpenAI & Sea AI Lab, where I saw and learned a lot about people building cool things in Rust, [Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)), C++.


## Fun Facts
I was part of the fencing team in École Polytechnique, specialised in Epée. And I was the first one to be knocked out in my team in a regional competition by 0-15.

The first programming language that I learned is Pascal. I used it to participate in the National Olympiad in Informatics and I made history with the lowest score ever in my high school.

I have done twice kayaking and canoeing in my life. The boats overturned and I fell into the water both times.
